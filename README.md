# SparkEC2 docker

This is a dockerized version of the Spark-EC2 scrip, which will allow you to run
the script in Windows (without Cygwin) or from any other environment as long as
you have [Docker](www.docker.com).

## Usage

The Docker image is part of the Docker Hub (it can be found
[here](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/edrevo/spark-ec2-docker/)) so you only
need to pull the image from docker:

```powershell
docker pull edrevo/spark-ec2-docker
```
